permalink: /publication/2024-10-10-LoGex
excerpt: 'In this paper, we aim to detect extremely rare tail-classes as out-of-distribution data. We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA) and diffusion guidance to generate targeted synthetic data for the detection problem and significantly improve the tail detection performance on a challenging histopathological task without losing classification accuracy on the head classes.'

In this paper, we aim to detect extremely rare tail-classes as out-of-distribution data. We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA) and diffusion guidance to generate targeted synthetic data for the detection problem and significantly improve the tail detection performance on a challenging histopathological task without losing classification accuracy on the head classes.
